# NOTE: This file is intentionally minimal/placeholder
# The actual runner-secret with the token is managed dynamically 
# by the gitea-runner-bootstrap-job, which generates tokens from 
# the running Gitea instance using:
# kubectl exec gitea-pod -- gitea actions generate-runner-token
#
# The bootstrap job creates/updates the secret directly and restarts
# the runner deployment to pick up the new token.
#
# This approach is correct because:
# 1. Runner tokens must be generated by Gitea itself
# 2. Tokens are instance-specific and can't be pre-defined
# 3. The bootstrap job handles the complete lifecycle
