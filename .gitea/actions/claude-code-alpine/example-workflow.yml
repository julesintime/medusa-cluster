            You are working in a Gitea environment. Be aware that:
            - Some GitHub Actions features may behave differently
            - Focus on core functionality and avoid advanced GitHub-specific features
            - Use standard git operations when possible
            - This is a test repository for Claude Code integration with Gitea
