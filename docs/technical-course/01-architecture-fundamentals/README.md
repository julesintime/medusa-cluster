# Architecture Fundamentals Course

**Master the design principles and patterns behind production-ready cloud-native systems**

## Course Overview

This architecture fundamentals course transforms you from someone who can deploy applications to someone who can design resilient, scalable systems. Built on the proven patterns from labinfra's production infrastructure, this course provides the mental models and design frameworks used by platform engineers at high-growth companies.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this course, you will:

- **Design Resilient Systems**: Apply proven patterns for fault tolerance, graceful degradation, and disaster recovery
- **Make Architecture Decisions**: Use structured frameworks to evaluate trade-offs between different technical approaches
- **Scale with Confidence**: Understand when and how to evolve from simple patterns to complex distributed systems
- **Communicate Designs**: Create clear architecture documentation that enables team collaboration and knowledge transfer

## Target Audience

### Primary: **Platform Engineers and Senior Developers**
- 5+ years of development experience
- Currently responsible for infrastructure decisions
- Need to justify technical choices to business stakeholders
- Want to build systems that support business growth

### Secondary: **Technical Leaders and Architects**
- Leading engineering teams through scaling challenges
- Making build-vs-buy decisions for infrastructure
- Need practical patterns for cloud-native adoption
- Want to avoid common architectural pitfalls

## Course Structure

### Module 1: System Design Principles
**Duration**: 2-3 hours | **Complexity**: Intermediate

Design data systems that support both current needs and future growth.

- **Data Storage Patterns**: SQL vs NoSQL decisions, polyglot persistence, caching strategies
- **Data Flow Patterns**: Event sourcing, CQRS, change data capture
- **Consistency Patterns**: ACID guarantees, eventual consistency, conflict resolution
- **Migration Patterns**: Zero-downtime schema changes, data pipeline evolution

### Module 4: Container and Orchestration Architecture
**Duration**: 2-3 hours | **Complexity**: Intermediate

Understand how Kubernetes design decisions affect your applications.

- **Pod Design Patterns**: Sidecar, adapter, ambassador patterns
- **Service Architecture**: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer trade-offs
- **Storage Patterns**: Persistent volumes, storage classes, backup strategies
- **Networking Patterns**: Service mesh decisions, ingress design, security policies

### Module 5: GitOps and Deployment Architecture
**Duration**: 2-3 hours | **Complexity**: Intermediate

Master the deployment patterns that enable reliable software delivery.

- **GitOps Patterns**: Repository organization, environment promotion, secret management
- **CI/CD Architecture**: Build pipelines, testing strategies, deployment automation
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform patterns, Ansible automation, configuration drift
- **Release Management**: Blue-green deployments, canary releases, rollback strategies

## Learning Methodology

### **Theory + Practice Integration**
Each module combines conceptual understanding with hands-on implementation using labinfra components.

### **Real-World Case Studies**
Every pattern includes examples from production systems, with specific metrics and lessons learned.

### **Decision Frameworks**
Rather than prescriptive rules, develop mental models for evaluating trade-offs in your specific context.

### **Progressive Complexity**
Start with core patterns, then build to advanced distributed systems concepts.

## Prerequisites

### **Technical Requirements**
- Comfortable with container concepts (Docker fundamentals)
- Basic Kubernetes experience (pods, services, deployments)
- Understanding of HTTP APIs and REST principles
- Familiarity with Git and basic CI/CD concepts

### **Business Context Understanding**
- Experience with production applications serving real users
- Understanding of business constraints (time, cost, team size)
- Awareness of non-functional requirements (performance, security, compliance)

## Success Criteria

### **Module Completion**
- Complete hands-on exercises with labinfra infrastructure
- Submit architecture diagrams for peer review
- Demonstrate pattern application in realistic scenarios

### **Final Project**
Design a complete system architecture for a realistic business scenario, including:
- Service boundaries and data flow
- Infrastructure requirements and scaling plan
- Monitoring and operational considerations
- Migration strategy from current state

## Course Materials

### **Interactive Labs**
- Pre-configured labinfra environment for hands-on practice
- Real deployment scenarios with actual infrastructure
- Debugging exercises with realistic failure scenarios

### **Reference Materials**
- Architecture decision record (ADR) templates
- System design interview preparation guides
- Technology comparison frameworks and decision trees

### **Community Support**
- Dedicated Slack workspace for course participants
- Office hours with course instructors

## Advanced Path

### **Follow-On Courses**
- **Security Architecture Deep-Dive**: Zero-trust principles, threat modeling, compliance frameworks
- **Performance Engineering**: Load testing, capacity planning, optimization strategies  
- **Platform Engineering**: Building developer platforms, infrastructure automation, team topologies

### **Certification Path**
- Complete all modules with practical demonstrations
- Pass comprehensive architecture design review
- Contribute to labinfra project with architectural improvements

## Why This Course Exists

Most architecture education focuses on theory without practical application, or provides cookbook solutions without teaching underlying principles. This course bridges that gap by using a real, production-ready infrastructure as the foundation for learning proven patterns.

You'll learn not just *what* to do, but *why* specific decisions were made, *when* to apply different patterns, and *how* to adapt these patterns to your unique constraints.

**Next**: Start with [System Design Principles](01-system-design-principles.md) to build your foundation.
