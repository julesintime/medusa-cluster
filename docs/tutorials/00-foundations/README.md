## The Foundation Series

### [Tutorial 1: What is Cloud-Native?](01-what-is-cloud-native.md)
*15 minutes | Conceptual overview*

**You'll understand:**
- The fundamental shift from traditional to cloud-native architecture
- Why companies like Netflix and Stripe use cloud-native approaches
- The four core pillars: containerization, orchestration, DevOps, continuous delivery
- When cloud-native makes sense (and when it doesn't)

**Key takeaway**: Cloud-native isn't about where you run code—it's about how you build resilient, scalable applications.

### [Tutorial 2: Containers Explained](02-containers-explained.md) 
*25 minutes | Hands-on practice*

**You'll learn:**
- How containers solve the "it works on my machine" problem
- The difference between containers, virtual machines, and bare metal
- Building your first container from scratch
- Container orchestration basics with practical examples

**Key takeaway**: Containers are the building blocks that make cloud-native applications portable and consistent.

**Hands-on exercise**: Create and deploy a containerized web application

### [Tutorial 3: Kubernetes Fundamentals](03-kubernetes-fundamentals.md)
*35 minutes | Practical walkthrough*

**You'll understand:**
- Why Kubernetes became the de facto container orchestration platform
- Core Kubernetes concepts: pods, services, deployments, ingress
- How Kubernetes manages application lifecycle automatically  
- The ecosystem of tools that extend Kubernetes functionality

**Key takeaway**: Kubernetes is the operating system for cloud-native applications.

**Hands-on exercise**: Deploy and scale an application on a local Kubernetes cluster

### [Tutorial 4: GitOps Workflow](04-gitops-workflow.md)
*20 minutes | Methodology deep-dive*

**You'll discover:**
- How GitOps transforms infrastructure management
- The difference between push-based and pull-based deployments
- Why Git becomes the single source of truth for everything
- Real-world GitOps workflows and best practices

**Key takeaway**: GitOps makes infrastructure changes as trackable and reviewable as code changes.

**Hands-on exercise**: Set up a GitOps workflow that automatically deploys application changes

### [Tutorial 5: Secrets Management](05-secrets-management.md) 
*25 minutes | Security fundamentals*

**You'll master:**
- Why traditional config files are a security liability
- Modern secrets management patterns and tools
- How to handle secrets in containerized environments
- Integration patterns for secrets in CI/CD pipelines

**Key takeaway**: Proper secrets management is non-negotiable for production applications.

**Hands-on exercise**: Implement secure secrets management in your cloud-native application

## Common Questions

### "Is this too advanced for my team?"
If you can deploy a web application and use Git, you have the foundation for cloud-native technologies. These tutorials start with basic concepts and build progressively.

### "Do I need to know Kubernetes to use labinfra?"
No! The labinfra project abstracts away much of the Kubernetes complexity. These tutorials help you understand what's happening under the hood, which makes you more effective at troubleshooting and customization.

### "How long until I'm productive?"
Most developers can complete this foundation series in an afternoon and feel confident enough to start deploying applications. Deep expertise takes longer, but you'll have working knowledge quickly.

### "What if I get stuck?"
Each tutorial includes troubleshooting sections for common issues. The labinfra community is also active on GitHub for questions and discussion.

## What Comes Next

After completing the foundation series, you have several paths forward:

### **Path 1: Practical Implementation** 
→ [Getting Started Series](../01-getting-started/README.md)
Jump into hands-on implementation with the labinfra platform. Deploy your first production-ready application.

### **Path 2: Deep Technical Understanding**
→ [Technical Architecture Course](../../technical-course/01-architecture-fundamentals/README.md)  
Dive deep into system design, architecture patterns, and advanced cloud-native concepts.

### **Path 3: Business Context**
→ [Infrastructure Business Blog](../../business/00-positioning/README.md)
Understand the business strategy and competitive advantages of cloud-native infrastructure.

### **Path 4: Specialization**
→ [Intermediate Tutorials](../02-intermediate/README.md)
Focus on specific technologies like service mesh, advanced monitoring, or multi-cluster management.

## Study Tips

### **Active Learning Approach**
Don't just read—follow along with the hands-on exercises. The concepts make much more sense when you see them working.

### **Connect to Your Context**
As you learn each concept, think about how it applies to applications you've worked on. What problems would it solve? What complexity would it add?

### **Build on Fundamentals**
Each tutorial builds on the previous ones. If something doesn't make sense, review the earlier material before moving forward.

### **Join the Community**
The cloud-native ecosystem is collaborative and welcoming. Join discussions, ask questions, and share what you're learning.
