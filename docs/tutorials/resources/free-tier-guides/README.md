# Free-Tier Setup Guides: Production-Ready Infrastructure at Zero Cost

**Complete, step-by-step guides for setting up production-grade infrastructure using only free tiers of services**

*Total setup cost: $0/month for small teams | Scales to production workloads | 100% compatible with enterprise requirements*

---

## Philosophy: Frugal but Production-Ready

These guides demonstrate how to build enterprise-grade infrastructure using **only free tiers** of best-in-class services. This isn't about cutting corners - it's about intelligent resource utilization that scales with your business.

### Why Free-Tier First?

**Financial sustainability**: Start with zero recurring costs, scale investment as revenue grows
**Skill development**: Learn with production tools, not toy versions  
**Risk mitigation**: Validate architecture before committing significant budgets
**Competitive advantage**: Deploy faster than well-funded competitors still procuring enterprise licenses

### Services Covered

All services included have **generous free tiers** sufficient for:
- Small to medium development teams (5-15 developers)
- Production workloads up to 100K requests/month
- Basic monitoring and alerting for critical systems
- Secure secrets management and CI/CD pipelines

## Cost Analysis and Scaling Paths

### True Cost Analysis

**Free Tier Limits and Realistic Usage**:

| Service | Free Tier Limit | Team Capacity | Scale Point |
|---------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Cloudflare | Unlimited bandwidth | 50+ team members | Never (stays free) |
| GitHub Actions | 2,000 min/month | 5-10 developers | $4/user/month |
| Infisical | 5 team members | 5 developers | $8/user/month |
| Grafana Cloud | 10K metrics | Small-medium apps | $8/month |
| Better Stack | 1GB logs/month | 10-20K req/day | $10/month |
| Gitea | Self-hosted | Unlimited | Server costs only |

**Realistic monthly cost for small team**: **$0-15/month** until significant scale

### Scaling Decision Points

**When to upgrade each service**:
- **GitHub Actions**: When CI/CD time exceeds 2,000 minutes/month
