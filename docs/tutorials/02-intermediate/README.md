## Common Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### Recommended Patterns

**Configuration Management:**
```yaml
# Good: Externalized configuration
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: app-config
        - secretRef:
            name: app-secrets
```

**Resource Management:**
```yaml
# Good: Explicit resource requests and limits
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi" 
    cpu: "500m"
```

**Health Checks:**
```yaml
# Good: Comprehensive health checking
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**❌ Don't:** Deploy without resource limits
- **Problem:** Can cause node resource exhaustion
- **Solution:** Always specify resource requests and limits

**❌ Don't:** Store secrets in container images
- **Problem:** Security vulnerability and poor operational practices
- **Solution:** Use Kubernetes Secrets and external secret management

**❌ Don't:** Deploy single points of failure
- **Problem:** Application unavailability during updates or failures
- **Solution:** Design for high availability with multiple replicas

**❌ Don't:** Ignore persistent volume backup
- **Problem:** Data loss during disasters or mistakes
- **Solution:** Implement automated backup and tested restore procedures
